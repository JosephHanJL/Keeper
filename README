Working keeper app that allows posting and deleting of notes, disallows empty notes (either empty title or empty content)
The backend is hosted on Railway. The front end is not hosted because of issues getting Vercel front end to interact correctly with
backend hosted on Railway. See Ed Post#72 which is unanswered by the time of submission of the final project.
To run project, simply cd to client folder and run npm start. The backend is hosted on Railway so no additional command is required.
The keeper page is initialized to be empty. Adding new notes will cause the notes to stay on the page until deleted. Refreshing does 
not remove the notes.
